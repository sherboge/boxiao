**Welcome to my website!**

I am a M.E. in printable organic electronic at **Wuhan University** (WHU) , advised by Professors [Jie Min](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uo3kHSkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Rui Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=kFtL9I4AAAAJ).

Prior to WHU, I have worked on single crystal analysis at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** (HUST) with Professors [Yunpeng Xie](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/xieyunpeng/en/index.htm).
